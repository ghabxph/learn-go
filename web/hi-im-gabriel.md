# Hi, I'm Gabriel

Well, nice to meet you. Welcome to my blog. As of the moment I write
this content, my thoughts are juggling. My thoughts are not really so
clear.

I just can't imagine myself, writing, and aspiring to write something,
and share my thoughts to everyone. If I recall myself in the past, I
always imagine to do anything but writing. I hate writing since I was
a kid. There is such thing called 'journal writing' in grade-school
days, and swear to god, I really hated it. I hate the times when teacher
ask us to write about some certain topic.

And now, here I am, writing something, and I'm happy and excited that
you are visiting and reading my blog. Very complete opposite of my past
self.

I wish to write my thoughts here. My technical experties, whenever I feel
like it to write, or even political stuff. There is such thing as social
media that can enable you to do these things. Facebook creates a platform
to enable you to sharing your thoughts online, but I don't feel using their
platforms. Instead, I built my own, for my sole personal purpose.

I could even use wordpress, or drupal, or any blog platform. Server is cheap
nowadays, but I chose to build things from scratch. I felt that it's kind of
boring if I will use their platform.

So basically, the intention of this blog, is to pursuit the ultimate happiness
in life. I feel happy doing this. I feel happy to write. It eases me, and
makes me feel better, and helps me to think clearer, and feel smarter. As
you read my stuff, I do encourage you to write your own blog too. It doesn't
matter if your content is good, nor your audience would like it. Just create
one, and start sharing your thoughts.

It is wise, if you are going to post things responsibly and held yourself
accountable, so avoid conflicts at all times. If you want to be very much open
about everything, then use a pen name, and create a plan on concealing your
trace online. From creating a new identity, to usage of VPN services, to
utilizing cryptocurrency, to avoid leads about yourself. Do not buy crypto
online, but instead, mine it. That way, whenever you earn at least one bitcoin
for example: there shall be no trace of about who you are.

Ah, so. How am I going to end this? Well, that's all. Thanks for reading :)
